About
=====

Load 3D models and see how to do it with this open source code application.

The main purpose of this app is to show how to draw in android using the OpenGL 2.0 by sharing the source code. 
So please, don't expect this application to be much richer or nicer than the ones already published in the app store, 
but at least it's unique in the sense it's opened to anyone who wants to contribute or don't want to start a similar 
project from scratch.

As this is my first android app and Im still learning the OpenGL 2.0 language, it is highly probable that there are bugs; 
but I will try to continue improving the app and adding more features. So please send me your comments, suggestions or 
complains to andresoviedo@gmail.com.

The app comes with some included 3D models that were taken for free from Internet (http://www.turbosquid.com).
